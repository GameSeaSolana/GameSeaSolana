Hi, welcome to GameSea!

Currently the only code we have available is for our FlagShip title, MetaPlunder. 
You can look over the Unity WebGL build and .html file to see how we connect our game to the Solana Network.

Try the free-to-play version here: http://www.metaplunder.io/demo

The expected launch time of the GameSea website is early-mid April 2022. We will update this repository with tools used to connect gamers to their blockchains.

Thanks for your time and interest!
Reach out if you are interested in helping. :) ethan@gamesea.world
